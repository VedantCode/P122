    <h1>GOOGLE LENS</h1>
    <p>I found that Google Lens had a more easier interface to navigate through than MobileNet and it had a wide variety of images to be recognized.<br>It is also a product of Google and Google is a reliable company to get your apps from.<br></p>
    <h1>I rate it an 8/10</h1>
</span>
<span>
    <h1>MOBILENET</h1>
    <p>MobileNet can easily be accessed with coding projects and can easily be integrated into the code.<br>It works best for coders and has a a wide variety of images as well<br></p>
    <h1>I rate it a 6/10</h1>
</span>
<span>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>I think that Google Lens would be better for most people because it benefits everyone and MobileNet only benefits coders.<br> It also is a product of google, which I said is more reliable.<br> So that is why I chose Google Lens as the winner</p>
